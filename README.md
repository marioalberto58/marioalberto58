Hi. My name is Mario Alberto Nina Gallo. I'm from Bolivia. I'm a student from UCB sede Tarija. I'm studying Mechatronics Engineering.
I like Mechatronics Engineering because I like learning about different areas.
I have a lot of interest. Although I don't have a lot of experience and skill in anything specific, I like to learn a little about everything.
My favorite hobbie is the music. I like to play guitar, keyboard, violin, drums and the voice. I'm not so good but I like.

I don't have any skills or potential that I can mention, I have several interests but I don't excel in any of them. However, that doesn't bother me, I like that about myself and even though I don't have any special skills, I like to think that my attitude of wanting to learn different things is something that can help me develop in different areas. Even if it is at a low level.

For now my codes were only made in PSeint and Python. Programs with a low level in my opinion. However, I am interested in going for more and with the bases that I have I feel safe.

My principal goal for now is to be a good student. But I have any little goals beetwen this moment and my principal goal.

I have a project in "Introduccion a la Programacion" asignature. Me and my teammates are "BELSTEIN". We want to make a program that, when processing a song, allows us to know the musical notes and then we can translate it into a guitar tablature format.
